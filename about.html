                <p>In 1886, a new process was discovered for smelting aluminum. As years progressed, and more uses for the metal evolved, a new industry emerged. 
                    The first company to capitalize on this new business market - The Aluminum Company of America (now known as ALCOA) – was formed to meet the new demand.</p>
                <p>
                    In the early 1900’s, aluminum powder was mixed with varnish and solvent to create a “paint” which had the unique properties of both corrosion protection and 
                    light reflectivity. The problem at that time was the ingredients could not be pre-mixed and supplied in sealed containers without an internal reaction occurring. 
                    Put simply, the “mixture” produced hydrogen gas and would “blow the lid off” of any sealed containers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 1921, through cooperative research with ALCOA and a company by the name of The Permite Corp. in Cincinnati, OH, a method and process for stabilizing the mixture 
                    was achieved. A patent was issued to The Permite Corp. in that same year, and the first ready-mixed aluminum paint became commercially available.
                </p>  
                <p>In 1967, Permite’s registered trademark and certain assets were acquired by present ownership and company headquarters was moved to Atlanta, GA.
                     Throughout the ensuing years, Permite has expanded into various markets and industries with continued emphasis on research and development. 
                     Permite has pioneered the use of the latest resin technology combined with high-performance materials such as aluminum, stainless steel, glass flake, 
                     and ceramics to provide leading-edge coating technology, and we have decades of successful results bolstering our position as an industry leader. 
                     Our continued success is due in no small part to an extremely dedicated group of employees who share one simple philosophy: “Listen to the customer.” 
                     Our accomplishments include a proud association with a broad base of customers you may very well recognize:</p>

                <p>We have several assets that help make our company safe and secure.  Our facility property is fenced and monitored by security cameras which all work together to 
                    control access and provide security for our products, raw materials, and all operating systems.  Our facility is also protected against loss due to fire by an 
                    incoming water main solely dedicated for sprinkler service throughout the plant, warehouse, and laboratory, and each of these areas is remotely monitored by ADT 
                    Security Services.  These measures are merely four (4) examples of Permite’s continued commitment to safety, security, and reliability all aimed at superior 
                    quality for our customers.</p>
               <p>We continuously meet and maintain high standards, as well as achieve constant compliance with applicable environmental regulations.  
                This compliance is regularly demonstrated via periodic internal audits in addition to external audits performed by our insurance carrier, 
                the Environmental Protection Agency, and Georgia Environmental Protection Department.</p>
               <p>Our production division contains a diverse combination of equipment that enables us to quickly and successfully meet the varied needs 
                of any customer.  The division houses twelve (12) milling stations, including high speed dispersers, sand mills, pebble mills, and a 
                myriad of both stationary and portable mixing vessels.  All equipment in the manufacturing facility is either explosion-proof electric, 
                pneumatic, or hydraulic.  Our diverse customer base provides our ability to offer packaging in 4,000-gallon tank trucks, 330-gallon and 
                275-gallon intermediate bulk containers, 55-gallon drums, 5-gallon pails, and 1-gallon containers.</p> 
                <p>As part of our rigid quality program, statistical process control assessments are made at various stages throughout the 
                    manufacturing process.  All critical raw materials are screened and require a certificate of analysis from the supplier 
                    before they are released to manufacturing for use. Post-manufacturing quality control is also performed within stringent 
                    guidelines specific to each product and color.  Both wet and dry samples are retained from each batch, allowing post-production 
                    quality control to be performed weeks, months, or even years after shipment.  Moreover, our proprietary tracking system allows 
                    timely access to quality-related information from batch inception through product delivery.</p>

               <p>Our property includes a dedicated rail spur serviced by CSX Railroad, allowing ease of shipments both domestically and overseas.  Moreover, the ports of Savannah, GA;
                     Charleston, SC; Jacksonville, FL; and Mobile, AL are all within close proximity.  We have twelve 10’ x 10’ elevated shipping and receiving bays, one 12’ x 15’ ground 
                     level bay for side loading of flat-bed motor freight service, and one 14’ x 15’ rail bay aside a 180 ft. track spur.  We schedule daily pickups from fourteen major LTL 
                     common carriers – with next day service to most locations in the Southeast and other markets such as Cincinnati, Indianapolis, and Chicago.</p>
               <p>With the development of truck shipping, we can now ship anywhere.</p>
